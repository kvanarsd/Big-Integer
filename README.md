#Pa6: Big Integer

## Description:
This program handles big integers and performs operations on them. The input file must contain two numbers and the outfile will perform these operations: 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐴 + 𝐵, 𝐴 − 𝐵, 𝐴 − 𝐴, 3𝐴 − 2𝐵, 𝐴𝐵, 𝐴^2, 𝐵^2, 9𝐴^4 + 16𝐵^5 

## Files:
Arithmetic.cpp is the top-level client for this program. It reads in the numbers from the input file and performs operations on the numbers and prints them to the output file.

BigInteger.h is the header file for the BigInteger ADT. It defines all the functions used in BigInteger.cpp.

BigInteger.cpp contains all the functions that can be used on the BigInteger ADT. It creates and modifies the BigInteger.

BigIntegerTest.cpp contains a main function that simply tests all the functions made for the BigInteger ADT.

List.h is the header file for the List ADT. It defines all the functions used in List.cpp.

List.cpp contains all the functions that can be used on the List ADT. It creates and modifies the List.

ListTest.cpp contains a main function that simply tests all the functions made for the List ADT.

Makefile makes and cleans all the needed files for this program.
